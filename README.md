project : Face-mask Detection Using Machine Learning

Model : 

a simple machine learning model that detectes  mask on a human face  using  :

+ Python3 
+ tensorflow
+ numpy
+ imutils
+ keras
+ opencv-python
+ scipy
+ matplotlib
+ CUDA Toolkit 11.2.
+ cuDNN SDK 8.1.0.
 
processes involved :

-- Project Initiation
-- Data Exploration
-- Data Processing
-- Model Development
-- Model Evaluation
-- Model Deployment

HOW THE TRAINING WAS DONE ?
the model has undergone very simple training using two datasets 
+with_mask
+without_mask
